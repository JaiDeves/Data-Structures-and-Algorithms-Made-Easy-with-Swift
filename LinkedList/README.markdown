# Linked List
A linked list is a sequence of data items, just like an array. But where an array allocates a big block of memory to store the objects, the elements in a linked list are totally separate objects in memory and are connected through links:

Properties:
1. Successive elements are connected by pointers
2. The last element points to NULL
3. Can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program.
4. Can be made just a s long as required
5. Does not waste memory space
